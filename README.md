# Movie Recommendation System with Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

This project leverages a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to build a personalized movie recommendation system. Using real-world datasets, the system learns from user interactions to suggest movies that are more likely to be of interest to the user. The model continuously improves based on feedback, optimizing the recommendation process for better user experience.

## Project Description

The movie recommendation system in this project uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to make personalized recommendations. The goal is to suggest movies based on a user's previous behavior, such as ratings and interactions with the platform. The model optimizes recommendations by considering the user's preferences, past interactions, and feedback.

**Features of the project:**

- **Movie Dataset:** Includes movie IDs, titles, and genres
- **Ratings Dataset:** User ratings of movies to help the model understand user preferences
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Used for continuous improvement of movie recommendations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Stable-Baselines3
- OpenAI Gym
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Dataset

### Movie Dataset
The movie dataset contains the following columns:
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie
- `title`: Movie title
- `genres`: Genres of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy)

### Ratings Dataset
The ratings dataset contains the following columns:
- `userId`: Unique identifier for each user
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie
- `rating`: Rating given by the user to the movie
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the rating was given

## Model Implementation

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Create a custom environment using OpenAI Gym where the agent interacts with users and movie recommendations

2. **State Space:**
   - The state includes user preferences and movie information such as genre and user ratings

3. **Action Space:**
   - The agent takes an action by recommending a movie from the dataset

4. **Reward Function:**
   - The reward is based on user feedback, such as movie ratings or interactions (positive feedback for high ratings)

5. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:**
   - The agent uses Deep Q Networks (DQN) or other RL algorithms to optimize the recommendation strategy based on user behavior

## Steps to Run

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Notebook

Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to train and test the RL model:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Train the Model

The model will be trained on the movie dataset using Reinforcement Learning techniques. The trained model can be saved for future use.
